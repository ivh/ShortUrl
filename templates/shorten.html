<h1>The no-nonsense, no-logging URL shortener</h1>


<form action="." method="post">
{{ url.non_field_errors }}
{{ url.url.errors }}
<p><label for="id_url">Shorten the long URL</label> {{ url.url }}</p>
<p><label for="id_key">to <em>http://tmy.se/</em></label>{{ url.key }}</p>
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
{% csrf_token %}
</form>

<p>Paste your long URL into the first field above, change the suffix of the short URL if you like, hit Submit. You will be led to a page that allows you to test the redirection from short to long. Plus it displays QR-codes for both.</p>


<h2>About</h2>

<p>Albeit bringing us closer
to <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2010/09/22/is-the-web-heading-toward-redirect-hell/">redirect
hell</a>, I found myself wanting a URL-shortener that is both
non-bloated (no fancy JavaScript or features noone wants) and
non-sneaky (I do not want myself or anybody else to track the visitors
that follow a certain link that I spread). This site has no user
accounts, no fancy layout and it does not log any activities. By
using permanent redirects it even makes your browser remember a short
link and it will not not need to come back a second time.</p>

<p>The source code can be
found <a href="http://github.com/ivh/ShortUrl">on GitHub</a>.

<h2>API usage</h2>

... coming very soon.
